Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow â€” from data cleaning and exploration using Python (Pandas), to database creation in PostgreSQL, and finally data visualization in Power BI.
The dataset used is the Netflix Titles dataset, which contains metadata about movies and TV shows, including their title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and duration.
This project aims to understand trends in Netflix content, such as the most active countries, release year patterns, and rating distributions.

ðŸ§  Objectives
Clean and preprocess raw Netflix data for analysis.
Explore and analyze the dataset using Pandas.
Store cleaned data in a PostgreSQL database.
Visualize insights using Power BI dashboards.



Tools and Technologies
Python (Pandas)	- Data cleaning and analysis
PostgreSQL - Database creation and storage
pgAdmin	- Database management and data import
Power BI	- Data visualization and reporting
ðŸ“š Key Learnings


Proper data cleaning greatly improves analysis accuracy.
PostgreSQL requires permission setup for CSV imports on Windows.
Pandas simplifies complex data analysis tasks.
Power BI is powerful for connecting databases and building visual dashboards.
